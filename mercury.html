<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;">Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system,<br> and it is also the planet closest to the Sun,<br> making it the most difficult of the planets to see with the unaided eye.<br> Because its rising or setting is always within about two hours of the Sun's,<br> Mercury is never observable when the sky is fully dark.</p>
